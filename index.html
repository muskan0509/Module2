           Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting  JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
